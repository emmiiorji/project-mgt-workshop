This project is an website for a Project Managers' Global workshop by Novustack.
It shows pertinent information about the workshop, including the program, speakers, sponsors, and contact information. A Gallery from past workshops is displayed also.

The development follows a mobile-first approach so you're sure to still have a good feel of the website on mobile devices. The home and about pages only are contained.
